NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::AutoRestart - Catalyst plugin to restart server
    processes when specified memory threshold is reached

SYNOPSIS
    use Catalyst qw/AutoRestart/;

     __PACKAGE__->config->{Plugin::AutoRestart} = {
            active => '1',
            check_each => '20',
            max_bits => 576716800,
            min_handled_requests => '150',
            size_field => 'size', # or any other field supported by
                                  # Proc::ProcessTable::Process
            restart => 'exit', # alternative is kill for a more graceful restart
     }

     <Plugin::AutoRestart>
        active   1
        check_each   20
        max_bits  576716800
        min_handled_requests   150
        restart exit
     </Plugin::AutoRestart>

DESCRIPTION
    Catalyst plugin to force the application to restart server processes
    when they reach a configurable memory threshold. Memory checks are
    performed every 'N' requests. This is intended as a band-aid to deal
    with problems like memory leaks; it's here to buy you time to find and
    solve the underlying issues.

CONFIGURATION
  active
    This is used to turn the plugin on and off

  check_each
    This is the number of requests to wait between checks

  min_handled_requests
    Minimum application requests before process size check starts occurring.
    This is to prevent your application processes from exiting immediately
    in case your application is bigger than your max_bits limit.

    The default is 500 requests

  max_bits
    This is the size virtual memory can grow to before triggering a restart

    The default is 524288000 bits (500 mb)

  size_field
    Which size field to measure. Defaults to "size". Other values are
    anything that Proc::ProcessTable::Process has an accessor for, which
    depends on your OS. Most people will want "size" (virtual memory size)
    or "rss" (resident set size)

SEE ALSO
    For trying to solve memory leaks see Devel::Leak::Object

EXTENDED METHODS
    The following methods are extended from the main Catalyst application
    class.

  setup
    Create sane defaults

  handle_request
    Count each handled request and when a threshold is met, restart.

  _debug_process_table
    Send to the log the full running process table and return the size of
    the process
